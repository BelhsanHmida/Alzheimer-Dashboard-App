## üß† **Introduction**

Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of Alzheimer's can lead to better management and treatment outcomes. This prediction system utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of relevant features to provide predictions about the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.

## üîç **About Alzheimer's Disease**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Though best known for its role in declining memory function, symptoms also include difficulty thinking and reasoning, making judgments and decisions, and planning and performing familiar tasks. It may also cause alterations in personality and behavior. The cause of AD is not well understood. There is thought to be a significant hereditary component. For example, a variation of the APOE gene, APOE e4, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

## üéØ **Purpose of the Project**

The purpose of this project proposal is to develop a machine learning model for the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Early detection is crucial for better patient care and the development of potential interventions. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease based on relevant data.

## üí° **Potential Impact**

The potential impact of this project on the issue of Alzheimer's disease is significant:

- Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease can lead to timely interventions, potentially slowing down the progression of the disease.
- Accurate prediction models can aid in identifying suitable candidates for clinical trials and research studies.
- Providing a tool for early prediction can raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and encourage individuals to seek early medical evaluation.

The model will be trained on a dataset collected from [Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/). This dataset is a comprehensive collection of clinical, imaging, and genetic data from individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
